We are interested in understanding the general principles of computation, how they are implemented, and how they emerge through learning in both machines and animal brains. The lab aims to span the full range, from applying theoretical techniques to the study of neuronal networks in abstract terms to modeling and analyzing specific neuroscientific data. 

We are always looking for highly motivated and committed theoreticians. We have open positions as [postdocs](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/work-at-ucl/search-ucl-jobs/details?jobId=28428&jobTitle=Research+Fellow+%28Training+Fellow+in+Theoretical+Neuroscience%29), if you are interested follow your formal application with a quick email. If you are interested in doing your PhD in the Lab, you could choose between the [Theoretical Neuroscience/ Machine Learning PhD](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/study-and-work/gatsby-unit-phd-programme) programme and the [joint Gatsby/SWC PhD](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/study-and-work/gcnu-swc-joint-phd-programme) programme. The former is more theory facing, and the latter is more computational facing, but through both of those you can work in collaboration with people at SWC. 
Twice a year we have openings for [paid internships](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/vacancies). In case you are interested in doing a [master](a.palmigiano@ucl.ac.uk) thesis project in the Lab please reach out directly to me.
