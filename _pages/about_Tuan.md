Tuan Nguyen studied Physics at MIT and is currently doing his PhD in Physics at Columbia University in Ken Millerâ€™s lab. He studies the connectivity and sensory feature encoding of the mammalian primary visual cortex and the development of these properties in the absence of visual experience. Through statistical analyses of biologically-plausible theoretical models, he seeks to elucidate the mechanisms by which visual inputs and behavioral state signals are integrated and modulate neural population responses. His research also explores computational models of cortical feature map development, examining how experience-dependent synaptic plasticity drives feature selectivity prior to eye-opening.
