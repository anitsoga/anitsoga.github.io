Tuan Nguyen studied Physics at MIT and is currently doing his PhD in Physics at Columbia University in Ken Millerâ€™s lab. He studies connectivity and sensory encoding in the mammalian primary visual cortex, focusing on development without visual experience. Using statistical analyses of biologically plausible models, he investigates how visual inputs and behavioral states shape neural responses. His research also explores computational models of cortical feature map development and synaptic plasticity before eye-opening.
